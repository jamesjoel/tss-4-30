            1. Variables
                    A varibales is a blank/empty container which can
                    store values. 

            In Javascript we can create a Variables by 

                let        --- re-init not allwed
                var     --- variales re-init 
                const   ---- fix value

            Roules for Naming The Varialbes

                1.  A variable name could not contain any spacial char (_ and $ accepted)
                2.  A variales name could not start with number.
                3.  A variable name is not a "KEYWORLD".
                4.  A variable name is Case-Sensative


        let fullname        let lastyearsalary 
        
        A. Snake Case       full_name       last_year_salary
        B. Camel Case       fullName        lastYearSalary
        C. Pascle Case      FullName        LastYearSalary
